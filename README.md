# Bootcamp_practica_SQL_DataModeling
Practical Exercise for Bootcamp "Mujeres en Tech" Glovo &amp; KeepCoding - Module Sql and Data Modeling:

First, I created an entity-relationship model with drawio to organise the database into its relationships, roles and cardinalities [ER_Schema_GiorgiaScuderi.drawio]

I then implemented the database using SQL with DDL and DML operations [BBDD_Script_GiorgiaScuderi.sql]

Finally, I realised a Query (DQL) using an inner join to obtain data as required by the bootcamp test [SQL_Query_GiorgiaScuderi.sql]
